# Chess App Front End

This front end was build using React.  The React app code can be found in the chess-app-view folder of this repository.

The code includes the game logic for chess that ensures only valid moves can be made as well as a view for the chess board, user login, and other features.

The backend is not deployed yet, but the front end is currently deployed at https://main.d2vnyrz11op24h.amplifyapp.com/.
